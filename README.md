## Effects of hurricane disturbance on potassium and nitrate (NO3) levels in Puente Roto Mameyes (PRM) and Bisley Quebradas 1, 2 and 3 (QB1, QB2, QB3) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico

goal: to recreate and redesign figure from https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/effects-of-hurricane-disturbance-on-stream-water-concentrations-and-fluxes-in-eight-tropical-forest-watersheds-of-the-luquillo-experimental-forest-puerto-rico/2511D4A53DA2C95406014ED75441E77B 

please run our tidy data functions prior to running the plots. Multiple packages are needed!

please put any bugs in our issues tab of the github repo :)

shout out to Schaefer, D,  et. al for the data and being our source:

## Effects of hurricane disturbance on potassium and nitrate (NO3) in Bisley and Quebrada Prieta A (QPA) Watersheds  in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico

goal: to explore data not included in first graph, and create a question that can be visually answered with a graph
question: How did this disturbance compare to other watersheds in the Luquillo Experimental Forest? (specifically how did the Bisley watershed and the QPA watershed compare in terms of K and NO3)

please run our tidy data functions prior to running the plots. Multiple packages are needed!
please run first graph's code prior to this one for full understanding of Bisley Watershed
